{
    History:
    Added overlay functions for Pchar->Strings, functions
    and procedures. Now you can mix PChar and Strings e.g
    OpenLibrary('whatis.library',37). No need to cast to
    a PChar.
    14 Jul 2000.

    Changed ReadArgs, removed the var for the second arg.
    Changed DOSRename from longint to a boolean.
    Aug 04 2000.

    Added functions and procedures with array of const.
    For use with fpc 1.0.7

    You have to use systemvartags. Check out that unit.
    09 Nov 2002.

    Added the define use_amiga_smartlink.
    13 Jan 2003.

    Update for AmigaOS 3.9.
    Added some const.
    26 Jan 2003.

    Changed integer > smallint.

 * The CSource data structure defines the input source for "ReadItem()"
 * as well as the ReadArgs call.  It is a publicly defined structure
 * which may be used by applications which use code that follows the
 * conventions defined for access.
 *
 * When passed to the dos.library functions, the value passed as
 * struct *CSource is defined as follows:
 *      if ( CSource == 0)      Use buffered IO "ReadChar()" as data source
 *      else                    Use CSource for input character stream
 *
 * The following two pseudo-code routines define how the CSource structure
 * is used:
 *
 * long CS_ReadChar( struct CSource *CSource )
 *
 *      if ( CSource == 0 )     return ReadChar();
 *      if ( CSource->CurChr >= CSource->Length )       return ENDSTREAMCHAR;
 *      return CSource->Buffer[ CSource->CurChr++ ];
 *

 *      if ( CSource->CurChr <= 0 )     return FALSE;
 *      CSource->CurChr--;
 *      return TRUE;
 *
 *
 * To initialize a struct CSource, you set CSource->CS_Buffer to
 * a string which is used as the data source, and set CS_Length to
 * the number of characters in the string.  Normally CS_CurChr should
 * be initialized to ZERO, or left as it was from prior use as
 * a CSource.

 * character stream to parse, else the input comes from the buffered STDIN
 * calls ReadChar/UnReadChar.
 *
 * RDA_DAList is a private address which is used internally to track
 * allocations which are freed by FreeArgs().  This MUST be initialized
 * to NULL prior to the first call to ReadArgs().
 *
 * The RDA_Buffer and RDA_BufSiz fields allow the application to supply
 * a fixed-size buffer in which to store the parsed data.  This allows
 * the application to pre-allocate a buffer rather than requiring buffer
 * space to be allocated.  If either RDA_Buffer or RDA_BufSiz is NULL,
 * the application has not supplied a buffer.
